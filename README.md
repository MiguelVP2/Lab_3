Scratch escape

The intent of our game was to expand our knowledge on unity to make something close to a 2d platformer, and gain some knowledge on how to do animation in unity.

The story of this is that Henry (the character) is just trying to enjoy his day out on the seaside. However, his nieghbor decided to unleash their cats to scratch Henry because he cheated in a game of poker twenty years ago.

The mechanics of this game use the arrow keys to move either left of right, and using the spacebar to jump. We used Open Game Pixel art for all our sprites. One of the main struggles was that their was only one computer to work with, and that hampered progress a lot. Another difficult part was getting the animations to even start. Howver, one joy was getting to test it and seeing the progress being made. Another thing that was good while creating this is that creating the other scenes were simple.
